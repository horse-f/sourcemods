This branch is for the saveloc plugin, current version is v3 (aug 07/2016). This plugin allows you to save your position, velocity, and eye angles with !saveloc. You can then teleport back to that location later with !tele or !teleport; or to a specific loc with !tele [#]. This is mainly for testing surf maps but you can use it and modify it how ever you want.
