This the dev branch for the saveloc plugin. This plugin allows you to save your position, velocity, and eye angles with !saveloc. You can then teleport back to that location later with !tele or !teleport; or to a specific loc with !tele [#]. This is mainly for testing surf maps but you can use it and modify it how ever you want.

There is an extra feature that allows you to save a loc to a file called locs.txt. The new commands are !writeloc and !loadloc.
